# Pew-Pew---A-Star-Wars-Inspired-Game
The aim for this iteration of Pew Pew was to implement two main game modes. One would be the original idea, which was a two-player, space-invader style shooter where players would aim to destroy each other's ships. A new game mode would feature a single-player, story-driven game with the same idea, only this time the player would be pitted against enemy bots. 
Currently only the two player option has been added.

Two-Player Features:
- Each player can choose their ship, from a range of Star Wars based ships
- Each ship has its own unique ability, such as stasis beams, large explosions, or speed jumps
- Each ship also has its own bullet patterns and movement speeds
- Players can play multiple rounds as the same ships, or choose to change after each round
- Cool explosion animation when one player is defeated
